          The current web-based app for an Upanishadic reader, which is part of
          the Sanskrit Knowledge Accessor (SKA) project, aligns closely with the
          objectives of the <strong>Bhashini program</strong> of the Ministry of
          Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY), Government of India.
          The Bhashini initiative aims to make digital content accessible in
          various Indian languages, promoting inclusivity and democratizing
          information dissemination.
        </p>
        <p>
          By providing <strong>multilingual</strong> translations of the
          Upanishads, the app supports the vision of enabling access to
          knowledge in diverse regional languages, ensuring that individuals
          from different linguistic backgrounds can engage with these ancient
          texts. Additionally, the incorporation of multimedia features such as
          audio narrations and visual aids enhances accessibility for users with
          varying levels of literacy, furthering the program's goal of reducing
          language barriers in the digital space.
        </p>
        <p>
          This initiative also complements the government's focus on preserving
          and promoting India's rich cultural heritage through technology,
          reinforcing the Bhashini program’s mission to integrate linguistic
          diversity into India’s digital ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, this Upanishadic reader app aligns seamlessly with the
          objectives of the{" "}
          <strong>Sanskrit Knowledge Accessor (SKA) project,</strong> which aims
          to digitize, analyze, and make accessible the vast repository of
          Sanskrit texts for a global audience, and is a project headed by the
          famous Sanskrit Scholar-technocrat Dr. Amba Kulkarni of the Central
          University of Hyderabad, Hyderabad.
